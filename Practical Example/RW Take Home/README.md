## APIs/Libraris, I have used in this project
- Auto Layout
- Custom UIView
- CollectionView with DiffableDataSource & CompositionalLayout
- Combine & URLSession
- **Kingfisher**: Downloading image for the CollectionViewCell is a common problem in the iOS Community and the community came up with mutliple solutions. Kingfisher is one of the most popular solutions. It is open sourced and actively maintained. That's why I have choosen this library to download the images. </br> ( RW iOS App also use this library )
